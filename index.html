				<hr>
				<p>There are stories among the tribes that live in the Amazon jungle about the Black Ghost Knifefish that when someone dies, their souls enter the body of these fishes and dwell there. The name of this fish comes from those native stories and legends.<br><br>
					
				The most spectacular aspect of Black Ghost Knifefish is probably the fact that they use an electric field to hunt and communicate. They are mostly nocturnal, so they stay active during the night and that's why their eyesight is not much developed. For this reason, they need an extra feature to assist them in communication and hunt and overall, complement their vision. This is where the electric field comes in. Through generating an electric field, they perceive the proximity of their surroundings and pass on information.<br><br>
					
				They're usually shy and prefers their own space. It's better to give them a hiding place while setting the aquarium. They might become aggressive if they're kept with other knifefishes. They swim with a sort of wavy movement which looks amazingly beautiful.</p>
