		<h2>Available Species at Aquamazing</h2>

		<p>Over the course of 2 years, there's been a few marine species that we had in our collection. We lost a few as well, due to unexpected causes. The following are the species that we collected since the start of Aquamazing. We hope to increase the variety of fishes gradually.</p>

				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Betta splendens</span> <br><br>
				
				<strong>Alternative Names:</strong> Labyrinth fish, Fighter, Betta. <br><br>
				
				<strong>Description:</strong> Betta fish can experience frustration and depression. While most of them can be happy in a tank alone, their environment still needs plenty of enrichment, such as caves, plants, and room to explore. They also experience stress - especially when their fins are picked at by other noncompatible fish placed in the same tank. <br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Black Moor Goldfish</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Carassius auratus</span><br><br>

				<strong>Identification:</strong> They can usually be spotted easily as a result of their distinctive black coloring. These fancy goldfish are born an amber coloration and have flat eyes. As they age their coloring darkens to a black coloration and their eyes begin to “pop” out. This eye formation is often referred to as the telescope shape in the goldfish world.<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Velvet Oscar</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Astronotus ocellatus</span><br><br>

				<strong>Personality:</strong> Oscars are victims of a brutish mug. Opportunistic piscivores, Oscars will make a meal of anything resembling a would be food item including tank mates that are small enough for the fish to get its mouth over and what a large mouth they have. For its size, Oscars are remarkably non-aggressive (compared to many other large cichlids), inquisitive and by some are considered to be the most intelligent of aquarium fishes. They should never be kept with African cichlids as they may harass and stress your fish to death.<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Koi Carp</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Cyprinus rubrofuscus</span><br><br>

				<strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> The koi has important symbolic meaning in traditional Chinese culture and Japanese culture, relevant accounts can be seen in various ancient Chinese poetry and literature since Jin dynasty; while in Japan, it's closely associated with the country's national identity, often as a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good fortune.<br><br>

				<strong>Behavior:</strong> When cultivating in ponds, it's better to sit by the pond during feeding so that they learn to recognize the owner. Koi that grow comfortable enough with their keepers will come to the surface and eat out of their hands. They may even leap out of the water as you walk by!<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Marble Veil Angelfish</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Pterophyllum scalare</span><br><br>

				<strong>Description:</strong> When angelfish are young, less than about 6 months old, they are a fairly peaceful community fish. As they grow, they actively pair up and try to breed, and this leads to them becoming highly aggressive as they try to defend their own little plot of land inside of your aquarium.<br><br>

				There’s a simple rule of thumb with angelfish: If it can fit into their mouth, it will probably end up in there.<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Black Ghost Knifefish</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Apteronotus albifrons</span><br><br>

				<strong>Description:</strong> An interesting story about this fish is one which is told by South American tribes. It is believed among the tribes that live in the Amazonian jungle, that the souls of the dead inhabit these fish. The common name of this fish, the Ghost Knifefish comes from these stories.<br><br>

				<strong>Behavior:</strong> As they are most active at night, their eyesight is not well developed, so they hunt and communicate through an electric field. They are quite shy and not very social preferring their own company – they can become quite aggressive if kept with other Knifefish. After they settle down in the new environment, they will come out from their hiding place during the night and swim mostly near the substrate or foliage and plants.<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Silver Angelfish</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Pterophyllum scalare</span><br><br>

				<strong>Identification:</strong> Silver body with red eyes; three main dark black stripes - one through the eye, and two more through the body. <br><br>

				<strong>Description:</strong> Silver angelfish have long been the backbone of the freshwater angelfish trade. They are the color variation that most closely resembles the "wild type" of the species, P. scalare. They are quite hardy and among the easiest of the angelfish to care for. The three vertical black stripes can fade or darken depending on the mood of the fish.<br><br>

				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Pterophyllum scalare</span><br><br>

				<strong>Identification:</strong> Mottled black and white coloration; varying amounts of gold on the head, depending on the selected genes; black marbling varies from 5 to 40 percent coverage. <br><br>

				<strong>Description:</strong> The koi angelfish has been bred to have coloration resembling that of the Japanese koi. When young, the fish may have a red hue below the eyes that fades with age. The amount of orange seen varies according to the stress level of the fish; the orange color will darken under higher stress. The koi variety is similar to the gold marble variety​ but without the stripes.<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Gold Gourami</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Trichopodus trichopterus</span><br><br>

				<strong>Identification:</strong> The gold variant has a gold colored body with a deep gold striped pattern running across the upper side of their body. <br><br>

				<strong>Behavior:</strong> As juveniles they are quite peaceful, but as they mature some are known to stay peaceful whereas others become more aggressive. They are best suited to fish of a similar size and temperament<br><br>

				<h3 class="fishName">Blue Gourami</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Trichopodus trichopterus</span><br><br>

				<strong>Identification:</strong> Blue gouramis have a beautiful silvery blue color. This fish is actually a color variation of the three spot one gouramis. <br><br>

				Their spots are good indications of the health of this fish. If they start to fade, it’s a sign they are either stressed or unwell. <br><br>

				<strong>Behavior:</strong> Blue Gouramis are possibly the most well known of the Gourami family. They are easy to care for ​and can be kept with other fish of similar size. Blue Gouramis do not tolerate others of their species well. This is particularly true of males, and it's recommended that only one male be kept in a tank. Several morphs exist, some with different patterns and colors.<br><br>

				<strong>Availability:</strong> Available.

				<h3 class="fishName">Rainbow Shark</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <span class="sciName">Epalzeorhynchos frenatum</span><br><br>

				<strong>Identification:</strong> The rainbow shark has an elongated black, dark blue or bright blue body. The snout is pointed. The abdominal area is flat. The fins possess red to orange-red coloration. The linear area from the gill cover, the eye, and the mouth has a characteristic brief stripe.<br><br>

				<strong>Behavior:</strong> Being bottom and mid-level dwellers, they consume leftover fish food, but also eat the algae growing off surfaces. They are usually peaceful with their own kind in the wild but aggressive with one another if kept together in a tank. Threat displays and fighting are likely to occur. This fighting behavior involves head-and-tail butting, and also biting. It may also increase the risk of the fish jumping out of its tank.<br><br>
