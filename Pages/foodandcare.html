				<h2>Food and Care</h2>

				<div class="article-body">
					<h3>Food</h3>
					<p>Fish food may vary depending on the species of fishes that an aquarium holds. Some fishes may have some delicate food habit. However, common food is also available that can be fed to all the fishes. This is more suitable if the aquarium hosts more than one fish species.
						
					<br><br>

					Here at Aquamazing we have several species, so we prefer the common food. These foods are available at the pet store.</p>
					
					<br>

					<h4>Amount and Feeding Time</h4>

					<p>Amount varies depending on the number of fishes present in the aquarium. It's best not to either overfeed or underfeed, because both poses danger on some level that might eventually kill the fishes.

					<br><br>

					We feed them twice, once in the morning and once in the evening.</p>

					<br><br>
					
					<h3>Cleaning</h3>

					<p>The tank needs to be cleaned and water needs to be replaced at a regular interval. The duration between 2 cleanups may vary, depending on how faster the tank gets dirty. The more the number of fishes, the faster the tank gets dirty. Gradually the tank gets filled with faeces, food particles and body fluids from the fishes. 

					<br><br>

					We usually clean the tank once a month, sometimes after 20 days. Sometimes, if the tank gets dirty even quicker, we replace half the water with new water and apply medicine accordingly.</p>
